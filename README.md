  # Housing Comparison Website

A modern React-based housing comparison platform designed for Dartmouth students to compare off-campus apartment listings with automatic currency and unit conversion features.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

### Installation & Running
 
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the website
If the dev server shows a different port, follow the URL printed by the server (Vite prints the exact local port when it starts).

Additional important files
├── index.html               # Vite HTML template that mounts the React app
├── package.json             # Project dependencies and npm scripts

Notes on important folders and files
- `src/main.tsx`: creates the React root and renders `<App />`. If you need to customize the router base or add providers (theme, context), do it here.
- `src/App.tsx`: defines application routes for `/`, `/compare`, `/map`, `/trends`. Look here to add new pages or change navigation.
- `src/components/ui/`: local copies/wrappers of shadcn/ui components. Reuse these across the app; they contain consistent styling and accessibility behavior.
- `src/data/mockData.ts`: contains the sample apartment objects used by the UI and charts. Update this file to change sample content.

How to run locally (detailed)
1. Open a terminal and change to the project directory:

```bash
cd '/Users/growingpenguin/Documents/HCI/Final_Project/Housing Comparison Website'
```

2. Install dependencies (only needed the first time or after changing package.json):

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

When Vite starts you'll see output similar to:

```
VITE v6.x.x  ready in 300 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. If the Local port differs (for example 5173), use whatever Vite prints as the Local URL.

Troubleshooting
- If port 3000 is already in use, Vite will pick another port (look for the Local URL printed by Vite). You can specify a port with `vite --port 3000` or add `server: { port: 3000 }` in `vite.config.ts`.
- If you need to access the dev server from other devices on your network, start Vite with `npm run dev -- --host` or set `server.host` in `vite.config.ts`.
- If types or build fail, run `npm run build` to reproduce production errors, then fix TypeScript or import issues shown in the console.

Verification
- I started the dev server in this workspace and Vite reported the Local URL `http://localhost:3000/`. If you run `npm run dev` in your environment you should see the same (unless the port is taken).

## 🎯 Original Design

This project is based on the original Figma design: [Housing Comparison Website](https://www.figma.com/design/JmJauZbaKlI9vDXJUAbto9/Housing-Comparison-Website)

## 🆕 Recent additions (Map UX Improvements)

- Persistent floating filter sidebar integrated as a reusable `FilterPanel` component.
- SVG-based heatmap overlay (rent gradient) and simple clustering for map markers.
- Hover tooltips with summary stats and click interactions that open the existing details panel.
- Accessibility improvements: aria attributes for tooltip and form controls.

These changes are intentionally implemented without removing or modifying original features; they layer on top of the existing MapView and FilterPanel so you can test them incrementally.
